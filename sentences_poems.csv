143,4,     springs from the gems of circassy-
144,4,     o! nothing earthly save the thrill
145,4,     of melody in woodland rill-

157,4,"     her world lay lolling on the golden air,"
158,4,     near four bright suns- a temporary rest-

160,4,     away- away- 'mid seas of rays that roll
161,4,     empyrean splendor o'er th' unchained soul-

167,4,"     she throws aside the sceptre- leaves the helm,"
168,4,"     and, amid incense and high spiritual hymns,"
169,4,"     laves in quadruple light her angel limbs,"
170,4,
171,4,"     now happiest, loveliest in yon lovely earth,"
172,4,"     whence sprang the ""idea of beauty"" into birth,"
173,4,"     falling in wreaths thro' many a startled star,"
174,4,"     like woman's hair 'mid pearls, until, afar,"
175,4,"     it lit on hills achaian, and there dwelt"
176,4,"     she looked into infinity- and knelt,"
177,4,"     rich clouds, for canopies, about her curled-"
178,4,     fit emblems of the model of her world-

182,4,"     and all the opal'd air in color bound,"

186,4,"     on the fair capo deucato, and sprang"
187,4,     so eagerly around about to hang

190,4,"     the sephalica, budding with young bees,"
191,4,"     upreared its purple stem around her knees,-"
192,4,"     and gemmy flower, of trebizond misnam'd-"
193,4,"     inmate of highest stars, where erst it sham'd"
194,4,"     all other loveliness,- its honied dew"
195,4,     the fabled nectar that the heathen knew
196,4,"     deliriously sweet, was dropp'd from heaven,"
197,4,     and fell on gardens of the unforgiven
198,4,     in trebizond- and on a sunny flower
199,4,"     so like its own above that, to this hour,"
200,4,"     it still remaineth, torturing the bee"
201,4,"     with madness, and unwonted reverie,"
202,4,"     in heaven, and all its environs, the leaf"
203,4,     and blossom of the fairy plant in grief
204,4,"     disconsolate linger- grief that hangs her head,"
205,4,"     repenting follies that full long have red,"
206,4,"     heaving her white breast to the balmy air,"
207,4,"     like guilty beauty, chasten'd and more fair,"
208,4,"     nyctanthes too, as sacred as the light"
209,4,"     she fears to perfume, perfuming the night,"
210,4,"     and clytia, pondering between many a sun,"
211,4,"     while pettish tears adown her petals run,"
212,4,"     and that aspiring flower that sprang on earth,"
213,4,"     and died, ere scarce exalted into birth,"
214,4,     bursting its odorous heart in spirit to wing
215,4,"     its way to heaven, from garden of a king,"

314,4,"     into the sunlit ether, caught the ray"
315,4,"     of sunken suns at eve- at noon of night,"
316,4,     while the moon danc'd with the fair stranger light-

362,4,     and zone that clung around her gentle waist

364,4,"     within the centre of that hall to breathe,"

371,4,     fountains were gushing music as they fell
372,4,"     in many a star-lit grove, or moon-lit dell;"
373,4,     yet silence came upon material things-
374,4,"     fair flowers, bright waterfalls and angel wings-"
375,4,     and sound alone that from the spirit sprang

630,8,"         in a kingdom by the sea,"
631,8,   that a maiden there lived whom you may know
632,8,         by the name of annabel lee;
633,8,   and this maiden she lived with no other thought
634,8,"         than to love and be loved by me,"

640,8,   with a love that the winged seraphs of heaven
641,8,"         coveted her and me,"
642,8,
643,8,"   and this was the reason that, long ago,"
644,8,"         in this kingdom by the sea,"
645,8,"   a wind blew out of a cloud, chilling"
646,8,         my beautiful annabel lee;
647,8,   so that her highborn kinsman came
648,8,"         and bore her away from me,"
649,8,   to shut her up in a sepulchre

651,8,
652,8,"   the angels, not half so happy in heaven,"
653,8,         went envying her and me-
654,8,"   yes!- that was the reason as all men know,"
655,8,         in this kingdom by the sea

657,8,"         chilling and killing my annabel lee,"
658,8,
659,8,   but our love it was stronger by far than the love
660,8,         of those who were older than we-
661,8,         of many far wiser than we-
662,8,"   and neither the angels in heaven above,"
663,8,"         nor the demons down under the sea,"
664,8,   can ever dissever my soul from the soul

666,8,
667,8,   for the moon never beams without bringing me dreams
668,8,         of the beautiful annabel lee;
669,8,   and the stars never rise but i feel the bright eyes
670,8,         of the beautiful annabel lee;

673,8,"         in the sepulchre there by the sea,"
674,8,"         in her tomb by the sounding sea,"
675,9,"the ring is on my hand,"

681,9,      and my lord he loves me well;

683,9,      i felt my bosom swell-
684,9,"      for the words rang as a knell,"
685,9,      and the voice seemed his who fell
686,9,"      in the battle down the dell,"
687,9,"        and who is happy now,"
688,9,
689,9,"      but he spoke to re-assure me,"
690,9,"        and he kissed my pallid brow,"
691,9,"      while a reverie came o'er me,"
692,9,"      and to the church-yard bore me,"
693,9,"      and i sighed to him before me,"
694,9,"      thinking him dead d'elormie,"
695,9,"      ""oh, i am happy now!"""
696,9,
697,9,"      and thus the words were spoken,"
698,9,"        and this the plighted vow,"
699,9,"      and, though my faith be broken,"
700,9,"      and, though my heart be broken,"
701,9,"      here is a ring, as token"
702,9,        that i am happy now!
703,9,
704,9,      would god i could awaken!
705,9,        for i dream i know not how!
706,9,      and my soul is sorely shaken
707,9,"      lest an evil step be taken,-"
708,9,      lest the dead who is forsaken
709,9,"        may not be happy now,"
710,10,"by a route obscure and lonely,"
711,10,"haunted by ill angels only,"

897,17,an essay on the material and spiritual universe
898,17,
899,17,"it is with humility really unassumed -‚Äìit is with a sentiment even of awe -‚Äìthat i pen the opening sentence of this work, for of all conceivable subjects i approach the reader with the most solemn -‚Äìthe most comprehensive -‚Äìthe most difficult -‚Äìthe most august,"
900,17,
901,17,what terms shall i find sufficiently simple in their sublimity -- sufficiently sublime in their simplicity -‚Äìfor the mere enunciation of my theme?
902,17,
903,17,"i design to speak of the physical, metaphysical and mathematical -- of the material and spiritual universe,‚Äìof its essence, its origin, its creation, its present condition and its destiny, i shall be so rash, moreover, as to challange the conclusions, and thus, in effect, to question the sagacity, of many of the greatest and most justly reverenced of men,"
904,17,
905,17,"in the beginning, let me as distinctly as possible announce -‚Äìnot the theorem which i hope to demonstrate -‚Äìfor, whatever the mathematicians may assert, there is, in this world at least, no such thing as demonstration -‚Äìbut the ruling idea which, throughout this volume, i shall be continually endeavoring to suggest,"
906,17,
907,17,"my general proposition, then, is this, -‚Äìin the original unity of the first thing lies the secondary cause of all things, with the germ of their inevitable annihilation,"
908,17,
909,17,"in illustration of this idea, i propose to take such a survey of the universe that the mind may be able really to receive and to perceive an individual impression,"
910,17,
911,17,"he who from the top of aetna casts his eyes leisurely around, is affected chiefly by the extent and diversity of the scene, only by a rapid whirling on his heel could he hope to comprehend the panorama in the sublimity of its oneness, but as, on the summit of aetna, no man has thought of whirling on his heel, so no man has ever taken into his brain the full uniqueness of the prospect; and so, again, whatever considerations lie involved in this uniqueness, have as yet no practical existence for mankind,"
912,17,
913,17,"i do not know a treatise in which a survey of the universe -- using the word in its most comprehensive and only legitimate acceptation -‚Äìis taken at all, -‚Äìand it may be as well here to mention that by the term ""universe,"" wherever employed without qualification in this essay, i mean to designate the utmost conceivable expanse of space, with all things, spiritual and material, that can he imagined to exist within the compass of that expanse, in speaking of what is ordinarily implied by the expression, ""universe,"" i shall take a phrase of limitation -‚Äì""the universe of stars,"" why this distinction is considered necessary, will be seen in the sequel,"
914,17,
915,17,"but even of treatises on the really limited, although always assumed as the un limited, universe of stars, i know none in which a survey, even of this limited universe, is so taken as to warrant deductions from its individuality, the nearest approach to such a work is made in the ""cosmos"" of alexander von humboldt, he presents the subject, however, not in its individuality but in its generality, his theme, in its last result, is the law of each portion of the merely physical universe, as this law is related to the laws of every other portion of this merely physical universe, his design is simply synoeretical, in a word, he discusses the universality of material relation, and discloses to the eye of philosophy whatever inferences have hitherto lain hidden behind this universality, but however admirable be the succinctness with which he has treated each particular point of his topic, the mere multiplicity of these points occasions, necessarily, an amount of detail, and thus an involution of idea, which preclude all individuality of impression,"
916,17,
917,17,"it seems to me that, in aiming at this latter effect, and, through it, at the consequences -‚Äìthe conclusions -‚Äìthe suggestions -‚Äìthe speculations -‚Äìor, if nothing better offer itself, the mere guesses which may result from it -‚Äìwe require something like a mental gyration on the heel, we need so rapid a revolution of all things about the central point of sight that, while the minutiae vanish altogether, even the more conspicuous objects become blended into one, among the vanishing minutiae, in a survey of this kind, would be all exclusively terrestrial matters, the earth would be considered in its planetary relations alone, a man, in this view, becomes mankind; mankind a member of the cosmical family of intelligences,"
918,17,
919,17,"and now, before proceeding to our subject proper, let me beg the reader's attention to an extract or two from a somewhat remarkable letter, which appears to have been found corked in a bottle and floating on the mare tenebrarum‚Äìan ocean well described by the nubian geographer, ptolemy hephestion, but little frequented in modern days unless by the transcendentalists and some other divers for crotchets, the date of this letter, i confess, surprises me even more particularly than its contents; for it seems to have been written in the year two thousand eight hundred and forty-eight, as for the passages i am about to transcribe, they, i fancy, will speak for themselves,"
920,17,
921,17,"""do you know, my dear friend,"" says the writer, addressing, no doubt, a contemporary -‚Äì""do you know that it is scarcely more than eight or nine hundred years ago since the metaphysicians first consented to relieve the people of the singular fancy that there exist but two practicable roads to truth? believe it if you can! it appears, however, that long, long ago, in the night of time, there lived a turkish philosopher called aries and surnamed tottle,"" [here, possibly, the letter-writer means aristotle; the best names are wretchedly corrupted in two or three thousand years,] ""the fame of this great man depended mainly upon his demonstration that sneezing is a natural provision, by means of which over-profound thinkers are enabled to expel superfluous ideas through the nose; but he obtained a scarcely less valuable celebrity as the founder, or at all events as the principal propagator, of what was termed the de ductive or a priori philosophy, he started with what he maintained to be axioms, or self-evident truths, -‚Äìand the now well-understood fact that no truths are self -evident, really does not make in the slightest degree against his speculations, -‚Äìit was sufficient for his purpose that the truths in question were evident at all, from axioms he proceeded, logically, to results, his most illustrious disciples were one tuclid, a geometrician,"" [meaning euclid] ""and one kant, a dutchman, the originator of that species of transcendentalism which, with the change merely of a c for a k, now bears his peculiar name,"
922,17,
923,17,"""well, aries tottle flourished supreme, until the advent of one hog, surnamed 'the ettrick shepherd,' who preached an entirely different system, which he called the a posteriori or in ductive, his plan referred altogether to sensation, he proceeded by observing, analyzing, and classifying facts -‚Äìinstantiae naturae, as they were somewhat affectedly called -‚Äìand arranging them into general laws, in a word, while the mode of aries rested on noumena, that of hog depended on phenomena; and so great was the admiration excited by this latter system that, at its first introduction, aries fell into general disrepute, finally, however, he recovered ground, and was permitted to divide the empire of philosophy with his more modern rival, -‚Äìthe savans contenting themselves with proscribing all other competitors, past, present, and to come; putting an end to all controversy on the topic by the promulgation of a median law, to the effect that the aristotelian and baconian roads are, and of right ought to be, the sole possible avenues to knowledge, -‚Äì'baconian,' you must know, my dear friend,"" adds the letter-writer at this point, ""was an adjective invented as equivalent to hog-ian, and at the same time more dignified and euphonious,"
924,17,
925,17,"""now i do assure you most positively"" -‚Äìproceeds the epistle -‚Äì""that i represent these matters fairly; and you can easily understand how restrictions so absurd on their very face must have operated, in those days, to retard the progress of true science, which makes its most important advances -‚Äìas all history will show -‚Äìby seemingly intuitive leaps, these ancient ideas confined investigation to crawling; and i need not suggest to you that crawling, among varieties of locomotion, is a very capital thing of its kind; -‚Äìbut because the tortoise is sure of foot, for this reason must we clip the wings of the eagles? for many centuries, so great was the infatuation, about hog especially, that a virtual stop was put to all thinking, properly so called, no man dared utter a truth for which he felt himself indebted to his soul alone, it mattered not whether the truth was even demonstrably such; for the dogmatizing philosophers of that epoch regarded only the road by which it professed to have been attained, the end, with them, was a point of no moment, whatever, -‚Äì'the means!' they vociferated -‚Äì'let us look at the means!' -- and if, on scrutiny of the means, it was found to come neither under the category hog, nor under the category aries which means ram, why then the savans went no farther, but, calling the thinker a fool and branding him a 'theorist,' would never, thenceforward, have any thing to do either with him or with his truths,"
926,17,
927,17,"""now, my dear friend,"" continues the letter-writer, ""it cannot be maintained that by the crawling system, exclusively adopted, men would arrive at the maximum amount of truth, even in any long series of ages; for the repression of imagination was an evil not to be counterbalanced even by absolute certainty in the snail processes, but their certainty was very far from absolute, the error of our progenitors was quite analogous with that of the wiseacre who fancies he must necessarily see an object the more distinctly, the more closely he holds it to his eyes, they blinded themselves, too, with the impalpable, titillating scotch snuff of detail; and thus the boasted facts of the hog-ites were by no means always facts -‚Äìa point of little importance but for the assumption that they always were, the vital taint, however, in baconianism -‚Äìits most lamentable fount of error -‚Äìlay in its tendency to throw power and consideration into the hands of merely perceptive men -‚Äìof those inter-tritonic minnows, the microscopical savans -‚Äìthe diggers and pedlers of minute facts, for the most part in physical science -- facts all of which they retailed at the same price upon the highway; their value depending, it was supposed, simply upon the fact of their fact, without reference to their applicability or inapplicability in the development of those ultimate and only legitimate facts, called law,"
928,17,
929,17,"""than the persons"" -‚Äìthe letter goes on to say -‚Äì""than the persons thus suddenly elevated by the hog-ian philosophy into a station for which they were unfitted -‚Äìthus transferred from the sculleries into the parlors of science -‚Äìfrom its pantries into its pulpits -‚Äìthan these individuals a more intolerant -‚Äìa more intolerable set of bigots and tyrants never existed on the face of the earth, their creed, their text and their sermon were, alike, the one word 'fact' -‚Äìbut, for the most part, even of this one word, they knew not even the meaning, on those who ventured to disturb their facts with the view of putting them in order and to use, the disciples of hog had no mercy whatever, all attempts at generalization were met at once by the words 'theoretical,' 'theory,' 'theorist' -‚Äìall thought, to be brief, was very properly resented as a personal affront to themselves, cultivating the natural sciences to the exclusion of metaphysics, the mathematics, and logic, many of these bacon-engendered philosophers -‚Äìone-idead, one-sided and lame of a leg -‚Äìwere more wretchedly helpless -‚Äìmore miserably ignorant, in view of all the comprehensible objects of knowledge, than the veriest unlettered hind who proves that he knows something at least, in admitting that he knows absolutely nothing,"
930,17,
931,17,"""nor had our forefathers any better right to talk about certainty, when pursuing, in blind confidence, the a priori path of axioms, or of the ram, at innumerable points this path was scarcely as straight as a ram's-horn, the simple truth is, that the aristotelians erected their castles upon a basis far less reliable than air; for no such things as axioms ever existed or can possibly exist at all, this they must have been very blind, indeed, not to see, or at least to suspect; for, even in their own day, many of their long-admitted 'axioms' had been abandoned, -‚Äì'ex nihilo nihil fit,' for example, and a 'thing cannot act where it is not,' and 'there cannot be antipodes,' and 'darkness cannot proceed from light,' these and numerous similar propositions formerly accepted, without hesitation, as axioms, or undeniable truths, were, even at the period of which i speak, seen to be altogether untenable, -‚Äìhow absurd in these people, then, to persist in relying upon a basis, as immutable, whose mutability had become so repeatedly manifest!"
932,17,
933,17,"""but, even through evidence afforded by themselves against themselves, it is easy to convict these a priori reasoners of the grossest unreason -‚Äìit is easy to show the futility -‚Äìthe impalpability of their axioms in general, i have now lying before me"" -- it will be observed that we still proceed with the letter -‚Äì""i have now lying before me a book printed about a thousand years ago, pundit assures me that it is decidedly the cleverest ancient work on its topic, which is 'logic,' the author, who was much esteemed in his day, was one miller or mill; and we find it recorded of him, as a point of some importance, that he rode a mill-horse whom he called jeremy bentham, -‚Äìbut let us glance at the volume itself!"
934,17,
935,17,"""ah! -‚Äì'ability or inability to conceive,' says mr, mill very properly, 'is in no case to be received as a criterion of axiomatic truth,' now, that this is a palpable truism no one in his senses will deny, not to admit the proposition, is to insinuate a charge of variability in truth itself, whose very title is a synonym of the steadfast, if ability to conceive be taken as a criterion of truth, then a truth to david hume would very seldom be a truth to joe; and ninety-nine hundredths of what is undeniable in heaven would be demonstrable falsity upon earth, the proposition of mr, mill, then, is sustained, i will not grant it to be an axiom; and this merely because i am showing that no axioms exist; but, with a distinction which could not have been cavilled at even by mr, mill himself, i am ready to grant that, if an axiom there be, then the proposition of which we speak has the fullest right to be considered an axiom -‚Äìthat no more absolute axiom is -‚Äìand, consequently, that any subsequent proposition which shall conflict with this one primarily advanced, must be either a falsity in itself -‚Äìthat is to say no axiom -‚Äìor, if admitted axiomatic, must at once neutralize both itself and its predecessor,"
936,17,
937,17,"""and now, by the logic of their own propounder, let us proceed to test any one of the axioms propounded, let us give mr, mill the fairest of play, we will bring the point to no ordinary issue, we will select for investigation no common-place axiom -‚Äìno axiom of what, not the less preposterously because only impliedly, he terms his secondary class -‚Äìas if a positive truth by definition could be either more or less positively a truth, -‚Äìwe will select, i say, no axiom of an unquestionability so questionable as is to be found in euclid, we will not talk, for example, about such propositions as that two straight lines cannot enclose a space, or that the whole is greater than any one of its parts, we will afford the logician every advantage, we will come at once to a proposition which he regards as the acme of the unquestionable -‚Äìas the quintessence of axiomatic undeniability, here it is, -‚Äì'contradictions cannot both be true -- that is, cannot coexist in nature,' here mr, mill means, for instance, -‚Äìand i give the most forcible instance conceivable -‚Äìthat a tree must be either a tree or not a tree -‚Äìthat it cannot be at the same time a tree and not a tree, -‚Äìall which is quite reasonable of itself and will answer remarkably well as an axiom, until we bring it into collation with an axiom insisted upon a few pages before -‚Äìin other words -‚Äìwords which i have previously employed -‚Äìuntil we test it by the logic of its own propounder, 'a tree,' mr, mill asserts, 'must be either a tree or not a tree,' very well, -‚Äìand now let me ask him, why, to this little query there is but one response, -‚Äìi defy any man living to invent a second, the sole answer is this, -- 'because we find it impossible to conceive that a tree can be anything else than a tree or not a tree,' this, i repeat, is mr, mill's sole answer, -‚Äìhe will not pretend to suggest another, -‚Äìand yet, by his own showing, his answer is clearly no answer at all; for has he not already required us to admit, as an axiom, that ability or inability to conceive is in no case to be taken as a criterion of axiomatic truth? thus all -‚Äìabsolutely his argumentation is at sea without a rudder, let it not be urged that an exception from the general rule is to be made, in cases where the 'impossibility to conceive' is so peculiarly great as when we are called upon to conceive a tree both a tree and not a tree, let no attempt, i say, be made at urging this sotticism; for, in the first place, there are no degrees of 'impossibility,' and thus no one impossible conception can be more peculiarly impossible than another impossible conception, -‚Äìin the second place, mr, mill himself, no doubt after thorough deliberation, has most distinctly, and most rationally, excluded all opportunity for exception, by the emphasis of his proposition, that, in no case, is ability or inability to conceive, to be taken as a criterion of axiomatic truth, -‚Äìin the third place, even were exceptions admissible at all, it remains to be shown how any exception is admissible here, that a tree can be both a tree and not a tree, is an idea which the angels, or the devils, may entertain, and which no doubt many an earthly bedlamite, or transcendentalist, does,"
938,17,

948,17,
949,17,"this thesis admits a choice between two modes of discussion, -‚Äìwe may as cend or des cend, beginning at our own point of view -‚Äìat the earth on which we stand -‚Äìwe may pass to the other planets of our system -‚Äìthence to the sun -‚Äìthence to our system considered collectively -‚Äìand thence, through other systems, indefinitely outwards; or, commencing on high at some point as definite as we can make it or conceive it, we may come down to the habitation of man, usually -‚Äìthat is to say, in ordinary essays on astronomy -‚Äìthe first of these two modes is, with certain reservation, adopted, -‚Äìthis for the obvious reason that astronomical facts, merely, and principles, being the object, that object is best fulfilled in stepping from the known because proximate, gradually onward to the point where all certitude becomes lost in the remote, for my present purpose, however, -‚Äìthat of enabling the mind to take in, as if from afar and at one glance, a distant conception of the individual universe -‚Äìit is clear that a descent to small from great -‚Äìto the outskirts from the centre if we could establish a centre -‚Äìto the end from the beginning if we could fancy a beginning would be the preferable course, but for the difficulty, if not impossibility, of presenting, in this course, to the unastronomical, a picture at all comprehensible in regard to such considerations as are involved in quantity -‚Äìthat is to say, in number, magnitude and distance,"
950,17,
951,17,"now, distinctness -‚Äìintelligibility, at all points, is a primary feature in my general design, on important topics it is better to be a good deal prolix than even a very little obscure, but abstruseness is a quality appertaining to no subject per se, all are alike, in facility of comprehension, to him who approaches them by properly graduated steps, it is merely because a stepping-stone, here and there, is heedlessly left unsupplied in our road to the differential calculus, that this latter is not altogether as simple a thing as a sonnet by mr, solomon seesaw,"
952,17,
953,17,"by way of admitting, then, no chance for misapprehension, i think it advisable to proceed as if even the more obvious facts of astronomy were unknown to the reader, in combining the two modes of discussion to which i have referred, i propose to avail myself of the advantages peculiar to each -‚Äìand very especially of the iteration in detail which will be unavoidable as a consequence of the plan, commencing with a descent, i shall reserve for the return upwards those indispensable considerations of quantity to which allusion has already been made,"
954,17,
955,17,"let us begin, then, at once, with that merest of words, ""infinity,"" this, like ""god,"" ""spirit,"" and some other expressions of which the equivalents exist in all languages, is by no means the expression of an idea -‚Äìbut of an effort at one, it stands for the possible attempt at an impossible conception, man needed a term by which to point out the direction of this effort -‚Äìthe cloud behind which lay, forever invisible, the object of this attempt, a word, in fine, was demanded, by means of which one human being might put himself in relation at once with another human being and with a certain tendency of the human intellect, out of this demand arose the word, ""infinity;"" which is thus the representative but of the thought of a thought,"
956,17,
957,17,"as regards that infinity now considered -‚Äìthe infinity of space -‚Äìwe often hear it said that ""its idea is admitted by the mind -‚Äìis acquiesced in -‚Äìis entertained -‚Äìon account of the greater difficulty which attends the conception of a limit,"" but this is merely one of those phrases by which even profound thinkers, time out of mind, have occasionally taken pleasure in deceiving themselves, the quibble lies concealed in the word ""difficulty,"" ""the mind,"" we are told, ""entertains the idea of limitless, through the greater difficulty which it finds in entertaining that of limited, space,"" now, were the proposition but fairly put, its absurdity would become transparent at once, clearly, there is no mere difficulty in the case, the assertion intended, if presented according to its intention and without sophistry, would run thus, -‚Äì""the mind admits the idea of limitless, through the greater impossibility of entertaining that of limited, space,"""
958,17,
959,17,"it must be immediately seen that this is not a question of two statements between whose respective credibilities -‚Äìor of two arguments between whose respective validities -‚Äìthe reason is called upon to decide, -‚Äìit is a matter of two conceptions, directly conflicting, and each avowedly impossible, one of which the intellect is supposed to be capable of entertaining, on account of the greater impossibility of entertaining the other, the choice is not made between two difficulties; -‚Äìit is merely fancied to be made between two impossibilities, now of the former, there are degrees, -‚Äìbut of the latter, none, -‚Äìjust as our impertinent letter-writer has already suggested, a task may be more or less difficult; but it is either possible or not possible, -‚Äìthere are no gradations, it might be more difficult to overthrow the andes than an ant-hill; but it can be no more impossible to annihilate the matter of the one than the matter of the other, a man may jump ten feet with less difficulty than he can jump twenty, but the impossibility of his leaping to the moon is not a whit less than that of his leaping to the dog-star,"
960,17,
961,17,"since all this is undeniable, since the choice of the mind is to be made between impossibilities of conception, since one impossibility cannot be greater than another, and since, thus, one cannot be preferred to another, the philosophers who not only maintain, on the grounds mentioned, man's idea of infinity but, on account of such supposititious idea, infinity itself -‚Äìare plainly engaged in demonstrating one impossible thing to be possible by showing how it is that some one other thing -‚Äìis impossible too, this, it will be said, is nonsense; and perhaps it is, -‚Äìindeed i think it very capital nonsense -‚Äìbut forego all claim to it as nonsense of mine,"
962,17,
963,17,"the readiest mode, however, of displaying the fallacy of the philosophical argument on this question, is by simply adverting to a fact respecting it which has been hitherto quite overlooked -‚Äìthe fact that the argument alluded to both proves and disproves its own proposition, ""the mind is impelled,"" say the theologians and others, ""to admit a first cause, by the superior difficulty it experiences in conceiving cause beyond cause without end,"" the quibble, as before, lies in the word ""difficulty"" -‚Äìbut here what is it employed to sustain? a first cause, and what is a first cause? an ultimate termination of causes, and what is an ultimate termination of causes? finity -‚Äìthe finite, thus the one quibble, in two processes, by god knows how many philosophers, is made to support now finity and now infinity -‚Äìcould it not be brought to support something besides? as for the quibblers -‚Äìthey, at least, are insupportable, but -‚Äìto dismiss them, -‚Äìwhat they prove in the one case is the identical nothing which they demonstrate in the other,"
964,17,
965,17,"of course, no one will suppose that i here contend for the absolute impossibility of that which we attempt to convey in the word ""infinity,"" my purpose is but to show the folly of endeavoring to prove infinity itself, or even our conception of it, by any such blundering ratiocination as that which is ordinarily employed,"
966,17,
967,17,"nevertheless, as an individual, i may be permitted to say that i cannot conceive infinity, and am convinced that no human being can, a mind not thoroughly self-conscious -‚Äìnot accustomed to the introspective analysis of its own operations -‚Äìwill, it is true, often deceive itself by supposing that it has entertained the conception of which we speak, in the effort to entertain it, we proceed step beyond step -‚Äìwe fancy point still beyond point; and so long as we continue the effort, it may be said, in fact, that we are tending to the formation of the idea designed; while the strength of the impression that we actually form or have formed it, is in the ratio of the period during which we keep up the mental endeavor, but it is in the act of discontinuing the endeavor -‚Äìof fulfilling as we think the idea -‚Äìof putting the finishing stroke as we suppose to the conception -‚Äìthat we overthrow at once the whole fabric of our fancy by resting upon some one ultimate and therefore definite point, this fact, however, we fail to perceive, on account of the absolute coincidence, in time, between the settling down upon the ultimate point and the act of cessation in thinking, -‚Äìin attempting, on the other hand, to frame the idea of a limited space, we merely converse the processes which involve the impossibility,"
968,17,
969,17,"we believe in a god, we may or may not believe in finite or in infinite space; but our belief, in such cases, is more properly designated as faith, and is a matter quite distinct from that belief proper -‚Äìfrom that intellectual belief -‚Äìwhich presupposes the mental conception,"
970,17,
971,17,"the fact is, that, upon the enunciation of any one of that class of terms to which ""infinity"" belongs -‚Äìthe class representing thoughts of thought -‚Äìhe who has a right to say that he thinks at all, feels himself called upon, not to entertain a conception, but simply to direct his mental vision toward some given point, in the intellectual firmament, where lies a nebula never to be resolved, to solve it, indeed, he makes no effort; for with a rapid instinct he comprehends, not only the impossibility, but, as regards all human purposes, the inessentiality, of its solution, he perceives that the deity has not designed it to be solved, he sees, at once, that it lies out of the brain of man, and even how, if not exactly why, it lies out of it, there are people, i am aware, who, busying themselves in attempts at the unattainable, acquire very easily, by dint of the jargon they emit, among those thinkers-that-they-think with whom darkness and depth are synonymous, a kind of cuttle-fish reputation for profundity; but the finest quality of thought is its self-cognizance; and, with some little equivocation, it may be said that no fog of the mind can well be greater than that which, extending to the very boundaries of the mental domain, shuts out even these boundaries themselves from comprehension,"
972,17,
973,17,"it will now be understood that, in using the phrase, ""infinity of space,"" i make no call upon the reader to entertain the impossible conception of an absolute infinity, i refer simply to the ""utmost conceivable expanse"" of space -‚Äìa shadowy and fluctuating domain, now shrinking, now swelling, in accordance with the vacillating energies of the imagination,"
974,17,
975,17,"hitherto, the universe of stars has always been considered as coincident with the universe proper, as i have defined it in the commencement of this discourse, it has been always either directly or indirectly assumed -‚Äìat least since the dawn of intelligible astronomy -‚Äìthat, were it possible for us to attain any given point in space, we should still find, on all sides of us, an interminable succession of stars, this was the untenable idea of pascal when making perhaps the most successful attempt ever made, at periphrasing the conception for which we struggle in the word ""universe,"" ""it is a sphere,"" he says, ""of which the centre is everywhere, the circumference, nowhere,"" but although this intended definition is, in fact, no definition of the universe of stars, we may accept it, with some mental reservation, as a definition rigorous enough for all practical purposes of the universe proper -‚Äìthat is to say, of the universe of space, this latter, then, let us regard as ""a sphere of which the centre is everywhere, the circumference nowhere,"" in fact, while we find it impossible to fancy an end to space, we have no difficulty in picturing to ourselves any one of an infinity of beginnings,"
976,17,
977,17,"as our starting point, then, let us adopt the godhead, of this godhead, in itself, he alone is not imbecile -‚Äìhe alone is not impious who propounds -‚Äìnothing, ""nous ne connaissons rien,"" says the baron de bielfeld -‚Äì""nous ne connaissons rien de la nature ou de l'essence de dieu, -‚Äìpour savoir ce qu'il est, il faut etre dieu meme,"" -‚Äì""we know absolutely nothing of the nature or essence of god, -- in order to comprehend what he is, we should have to be god ourselves,"""
978,17,
979,17,"""we should have to be god ourselves!"" -‚Äìwith a phrase so startling as this yet ringing in my ears, i nevertheless venture to demand if this our present ignorance of the deity is an ignorance to which the soul is everlastingly condemned,"
980,17,
981,17,"by him, however -‚Äìnow, at least, the incomprehensible -‚Äìby him -- assuming him as spirit -‚Äìthat is to say, as not matter -‚Äìa distinction which, for all intelligible purposes, will stand well instead of a definition -‚Äìby him, then, existing as spirit, let us content ourselves, to-night, with supposing to have been created, or made out of nothing, by dint of his volition -‚Äìat some point of space which we will take as a centre -‚Äìat some period into which we do not pretend to inquire, but at all events immensely remote -‚Äìby him, then again, let us suppose to have been created -‚Äìwhat? this is a vitally momentous epoch in our considerations, what is it that we are justified -‚Äìthat alone we are justified in supposing to have been, primarily and solely, created?"
982,17,
983,17,"we have attained a point where only intuition can aid us, -‚Äìbut now let me recur to the idea which i have already suggested as that alone which we can properly entertain of intuition, it is but the conviction arising from those inductions or deductions of which the processes are so shadowy as to escape our consciousness, elude our reason, or defy our capacity of expression, with this understanding, i now assert -‚Äìthat an intuition altogether irresistible, although inexpressible, forces me to the conclusion that what god originally created -‚Äìthat that matter which, by dint of his volition, he first made from his spirit, or from nihility, could have been nothing but matter in its utmost conceivable state of -- what? -‚Äìof simplicity?"
984,17,
985,17,"this will be found the sole absolute assumption of my discourse, i use the word ""assumption"" in its ordinary sense; yet i maintain that even this my primary proposition, is very, very far indeed, from being really a mere assumption, nothing was ever more certainly -‚Äìno human conclusion was ever, in fact, more regularly -‚Äìmore rigorously de duced, -‚Äìbut, alas! the processes lie out of the human analysis -‚Äìat all events are beyond the utterance of the human tongue,"
986,17,
987,17,"let us now endeavor to conceive what matter must be, when, or if, in its absolute extreme of simplicity, here the reason flies at once to imparticularity -‚Äìto a particle -‚Äìto one particle -‚Äìa particle of one kind -‚Äìof one character -‚Äìof one nature -‚Äìof one size -‚Äìof one form -- a particle, therefore, ""without form and void"" -‚Äìa particle positively a particle at all points -‚Äìa particle absolutely unique, individual, undivided, and not indivisible only because he who created it, by dint of his will, can by an infinitely less energetic exercise of the same will, as a matter of course, divide it,"
988,17,
989,17,"oneness, then, is all that i predicate of the originally created matter; but i propose to show that this oneness is a principle abundantly sufficient to account for the constitution, the existing phaenomena and the plainly inevitable annihilation of at least the material universe,"
990,17,
991,17,"the willing into being the primordial particle, has completed the act, or more properly the conception, of creation, we now proceed to the ultimate purpose for which we are to suppose the particle created -- that is to say, the ultimate purpose so far as our considerations yet enable us to see it -‚Äìthe constitution of the universe from it, the particle,"
992,17,
993,17,"this constitution has been effected by forcing the originally and therefore normally one into the abnormal condition of many, an action of this character implies reaction, a diffusion from unity, under the conditions, involves a tendency to return into unity -‚Äìa tendency ineradicable until satisfied, but on these points i will speak more fully hereafter,"
994,17,
995,17,"the assumption of absolute unity in the primordial particle includes that of infinite divisibility, let us conceive the particle, then, to be only not totally exhausted by diffusion into space, from the one particle, as a centre, let us suppose to be irradiated spherically -‚Äìin all directions -‚Äìto immeasurable but still to definite distances in the previously vacant space -‚Äìa certain inexpressibly great yet limited number of unimaginably yet not infinitely minute atoms,"
996,17,
997,17,"now, of these atoms, thus diffused, or upon diffusion, what conditions are we permitted -‚Äìnot to assume, but to infer, from consideration as well of their source as of the character of the design apparent in their diffusion? unity being their source, and difference from unity the character of the design manifested in their diffusion, we are warranted in supposing this character to be at least generally preserved throughout the design, and to form a portion of the design itself, -‚Äìthat is to say, we shall be warranted in conceiving continual differences at all points from the uniquity and simplicity of the origin, but, for these reasons, shall we be justified in imagining the atoms heterogeneous, dissimilar, unequal, and inequidistant? more explicitly -‚Äìare we to consider no two atoms as, at their diffusion, of the same nature, or of the same form, or of the same size? -‚Äìand, after fulfilment of their diffusion into space, is absolute inequidistance, each from each, to be understood of all of them? in such arrangement, under such conditions, we most easily and immediately comprehend the subsequent most feasible carrying out to completion of any such design as that which i have suggested -‚Äìthe design of variety out of unity -‚Äìdiversity out of sameness -- heterogeneity out of homogeneity -‚Äìcomplexity out of simplicity -‚Äìin a word, the utmost possible multiplicity of relation out of the emphatically irrelative one, undoubtedly, therefore, we should be warranted in assuming all that has been mentioned, but for the reflection, first, that supererogation is not presumable of any divine act; and, secondly, that the object supposed in view, appears as feasible when some of the conditions in question are dispensed with, in the beginning, as when all are understood immediately to exist, i mean to say that some are involved in the rest, or so instantaneous a consequence of them as to make the distinction inappreciable, difference of size, for example, will at once be brought about through the tendency of one atom to a second, in preference to a third, on account of particular inequidistance; which is to be comprehended as particular inequidistances between centres of quantity, in neighboring atoms of different form -‚Äìa matter not at all interfering with the generally-equable distribution of the atoms, difference of kind, too, is easily conceived to be merely a result of differences in size and form, taken more or less conjointly, -‚Äìin fact, since the unity of the particle proper implies absolute homogeneity, we cannot imagine the atoms, at their diffusion, differing in kind, without imagining, at the same time, a special exercise of the divine will, at the emission of each atom, for the purpose of effecting, in each, a change of its essential nature, -‚Äìso fantastic an idea is the less to be indulged, as the object proposed is seen to be thoroughly attainable without such minute and elaborate interposition, we perceive, therefore, upon the whole, that it would be supererogatory, and consequently unphilosophical, to predicate of the atoms, in view of their purposes, any thing more than difference of form at their dispersion, with particular inequidistance after it -‚Äìall other differences arising at once out of these, in the very first processes of mass-constitution, -‚Äìwe thus establish the universe on a purely geometrical basis, of course, it is by no means necessary to assume absolute difference, even of form, among the atoms irradiated -‚Äìany more than absolute particular inequidistance of each from each, we are required to conceive merely that no neighboring atoms are of similar form -‚Äìno atoms which can ever approximate, until their inevitable reunition at the end,"
998,17,
999,17,"although the immediate and perpetual tendency of the disunited atoms to return into their normal unity, is implied, as i have said, in their abnormal diffusion; still it is clear that this tendency will be without consequence -‚Äìa tendency and no more -‚Äìuntil the diffusive energy, in ceasing to be exerted, shall leave it, the tendency, free to seek its satisfaction, the divine act, however, being considered as determinate, and discontinued on fulfilment of the diffusion, we understand, at once, a reaction -‚Äìin other words, a satisfiable tendency of the disunited atoms to return into one,"
1000,17,
1001,17,"but the diffusive energy being withdrawn, and the reaction having commenced in furtherance of the ultimate design -‚Äìthat of the utmost possible relation -‚Äìthis design is now in danger of being frustrated, in detail, by reason of that very tendency to return which is to effect its accomplishment in general, multiplicity is the object; but there is nothing to prevent proximate atoms, from lapsing at once, through the now satisfiable tendency -‚Äìbefore the fulfilment of any ends proposed in multiplicity -‚Äìinto absolute oneness among themselves, -‚Äìthere is nothing to impede the aggregation of various unique masses, at various points of space, -- in other words, nothing to interfere with the accumulation of various masses, each absolutely one,"
1002,17,
1003,17,"for the effectual and thorough completion of the general design, we thus see the necessity for a repulsion of limited capacity -‚Äìa separate something which, on withdrawal of the diffusive volition, shall at the same time allow the approach, and forbid the junction, of the atoms; suffering them infinitely to approximate, while denying them positive contact; in a word, having the power -‚Äìup to a certain epoch -‚Äìof preventing their coalition, but no ability to interfere with their coalescence in any respect or degree, the repulsion, already considered as so peculiarly limited in other regards, must be understood, let me repeat, as having power to prevent absolute coalition, only up to a certain epoch, unless we are to conceive that the appetite for unity among the atoms is doomed to be satisfied never; -‚Äìunless we are to conceive that what had a beginning is to have no end -‚Äìa conception which cannot really be entertained, however much we may talk or dream of entertaining it -- we are forced to conclude that the repulsive influence imagined, will, finally -‚Äìunder pressure of the uni-tendency collectively applied, but, never and in no degree until, on fulfilment of the divine purposes, such collective application shall be naturally made -‚Äìyield to a force which, at that ultimate epoch, shall be the superior force precisely to the extent required, and thus permit the universal subsidence into the inevitable, because original and therefore normal, one, -‚Äìthe conditions here to be reconciled are difficult indeed, -‚Äìwe cannot even comprehend the possibility of their conciliation; -‚Äìnevertheless, the apparent impossibility is brilliantly suggestive,"
1004,17,
1005,17,"that the repulsive something actually exists, we see, man neither employs, nor knows, a force sufficient to bring two atoms into contact, this is but the well-established proposition of the impenetrability of matter, all experiment proves -‚Äìall philosophy admits it, the design of the repulsion -‚Äìthe necessity for its existence -‚Äìi have endeavored to show; but from all attempt at investigating its nature have religiously abstained; this on account of an intuitive conviction that the principle at issue is strictly spiritual -‚Äìlies in a recess impervious to our present understanding -- lies involved in a consideration of what now -‚Äìin our human state -‚Äìis not to be considered -‚Äìin a consideration of spirit in itself, i feel, in a word, that here the god has interposed, and here only, because here and here only the knot demanded the interposition of the god,"
1006,17,
1007,17,"in fact, while the tendency of the diffused atoms to return into unity, will be recognized, at once, as the principle of the newtonian gravity, what i have spoken of as a repulsive influence prescribing limits to the immediate satisfaction of the tendency, will be understood as that which we have been in the practice of designating now as heat, now as magnetism, now as electricity; displaying our ignorance of its awful character in the vacillation of the phraseology with which we endeavor to circumscribe it,"
1008,17,
1009,17,"calling it, merely for the moment, electricity, we know that all experimental analysis of electricity has given, as an ultimate result, the principle, or seeming principle, heterogeneity, only where things differ is electricity apparent; and it is presumable that they never differ where it is not developed at least, if not apparent, now, this result is in the fullest keeping with that which i have reached unempirically, the design of the repulsive influence i have maintained to be that of preventing immediate unity among the diffused atoms; and these atoms are represented as different each from each, difference is their character -‚Äìtheir essentiality -‚Äìjust as no-difference was the essentiality of their course, when we say, then, that an attempt to bring any two of these atoms together would induce an effort, on the part of the repulsive influence, to prevent the contact we may as well use the strictly convertible sentence that an attempt to bring together any two differences will result in a development of electricity, all existing bodies, of course, are composed of these atoms in proximate contact, and are therefore to be considered as mere assemblages of more or fewer differences; and the resistance made by the repulsive spirit, on bringing together any two such assemblages, would be in the ratio of the two sums of the differences in each, -‚Äìan expression which, when reduced, is equivalent to this, -‚Äìthe amount of electricity developed on the approximation of two bodies, is proportional to the difference between the respective sums of the atoms of which the bodies are composed, that no two bodies are absolutely alike, is a simple corollary from all that has been here said, electricity, therefore, existing always, is developed whenever any bodies, but manifested only when bodies of appreciable difference, are brought into approximation,"
1010,17,
1011,17,"to electricity -‚Äìso, for the present, continuing to call it -‚Äìwe may not be wrong in referring the various physical appearances of light, heat and magnetism; but far less shall we be liable to err in attributing to this strictly spiritual principle the more important phaenomena of vitality, consciousness and thought, on this topic, however, i need pause here merely to suggest that these phaenomena, whether observed generally or in detail, seem to proceed at least in the ratio of the heterogeneous,"
1012,17,
1013,17,"discarding now the two equivocal terms, ""gravitation"" and ""electricity,"" let us adopt the more definite expressions, ""attraction"" and ""repulsion,"" the former is the body; the latter the soul, the one is the material; the other the spiritual, principle of the universe, no other principles exist, all phaenomena are referable to one, or to the other, or to both combined, so rigorously is this the case -‚Äìso thoroughly demonstrable is it that attraction and repulsion are the sole properties through which we perceive the universe -‚Äìin other words, by which matter is manifested to mind -‚Äìthat, for all merely argumentative purposes, we are fully justified in assuming that matter exists only as attraction and repulsion -‚Äìthat attraction and repulsion are matter, -‚Äìthere being no conceivable case in which we may not employ the term ""matter"" and the terms ""attraction"" and ""repulsion,"" taken together, as equivalent, and therefore convertible, expressions in logic,"
1014,17,
1015,17,"i said, just now, that what i have described as the tendency of the diffused atoms to return into their original unity, would be understood as the principle of the newtonian law of gravity, and, in fact, there can be but little difficulty in such an understanding, if we look at the newtonian gravity in a merely general view, as a force impelling matter to seek matter; that is to say, when we pay no attention to the known modus operandi of the newtonian force, the general coincidence satisfies us; but, upon looking closely, we see, in detail, much that appears in coincident, and much in regard to which no coincidence, at least, is established, for example; the newtonian gravity, when we think of it in certain moods, does not seem to be a tendency to oneness at all, but rather a tendency of all bodies in all directions -‚Äìa phrase apparently expressive of a tendency to diffusion, here, then, is an in coincidence, again; when we reflect on the mathematical la0 governing the newtonian tendency, we see clearly that no coincidence has been made good, in respect of the modus operandi, at least, between gravitation as known to exist and that seemingly simple and direct tendency which i have assumed,"
1016,17,
1017,17,"in fact, i have attained a point at which it will be advisable to strengthen my position by reversing my processes, so far, we have gone on a priori, from an abstract consideration of simplicity, as that quality most likely to have characterized the original action of god, let us now see whether the established facts of the newtonian gravitation may not afford us, a posteriori, some legitimate inductions,"
1018,17,
1019,17,"what does the newtonian law declare? -‚Äìthat all bodies attract each other with forces proportional to their quantities of matter and inversely proportional to the squares of their distances, purposely, i have here given, in the first place, the vulgar version of the law; and i confess that in this, as in most other vulgar versions of great truths, we find little of a suggestive character, let us now adopt a more philosophical phraseology, -‚Äìevery atom, of every body, attracts every other atom, both of its own and of every other body, with a force which varies inversely as the squares of the distances between the attracting and attracted atom, -‚Äìhere, indeed, a flood of suggestion bursts upon the mind,"
1020,17,
1021,17,"but let us see distinctly what it was that newton proved -- according to the grossly irrational definitions of proof prescribed by the metaphysical schools, he was forced to content himself with showing how thoroughly the motions of an imaginary universe, composed of attracting and attracted atoms obedient to the law he announced, coincide with those of the actually existing universe so far as it comes under our observation, this was the amount of his demonstration -‚Äìthat is to say, this was the amount of it, according to the conventional cant of the ""philosophies,"" his successes added proof multiplied by proof -‚Äìsuch proof as a sound intellect admits -‚Äìbut the demonstration of the law itself, persist the metaphysicians, had not been strengthened in any degree, ""ocular, physical proof,"" however, of attraction, here upon earth, in accordance with the newtonian theory, was, at length, much to the satisfaction of some intellectual grovellers, afforded, this proof arose collaterally and incidentally as nearly all important truths have arisen out of an attempt to ascertain the mean density of the earth, in the famous maskelyne, cavendish and bailly experiments for this purpose, the attraction of the mass of a mountain was seen, felt, measured, and found to be mathematically consistent with the immortal theory of the british astronomer,"
1022,17,
1023,17,"but in spite of this confirmation of that which needed none -‚Äìin spite of the so-called corroboration of the ""theory"" by the so-called ""ocular and physical proof"" -‚Äìin spite of the character of this corroboration -‚Äìthe ideas which even really philosophical men cannot help imbibing of gravity -‚Äìand, especially, the ideas of it which ordinary men get and contentedly maintain, are seen to have been derived, for the most part, from a consideration of the principle as they find it developed -‚Äìmerely in the planet upon which they stand,"
1024,17,
1025,17,"now, to what does so partial a consideration tend -‚Äìto what species of error does it give rise? on the earth we see and feel, only that gravity impels all bodies towards the centre of the earth, no man in the common walks of life could be made to see or feel anything else -‚Äìcould be made to perceive that anything, anywhere, has a perpetual, gravitating tendency in any other direction than to the centre of the earth; yet with an exception hereafter to be specified it is a fact that every earthly thing not to speak now of every heavenly thing has a tendency not only to the earth's centre but in every conceivable direction besides,"
1026,17,
1027,17,"now, although the philosophic cannot be said to err with the vulgar in this matter, they nevertheless permit themselves to be influenced, without knowing it, by the sentiment of the vulgar idea, ""although the pagan fables are not believed,"" says bryant, in his very erudite ""mythology,"" ""yet we forget ourselves continually and make inferences from them as from existing realities,"" i mean to assert that the merely sensitive perception of gravity as we experience it on earth, beguiles mankind into the fancy of concentralization or especiality respecting it -‚Äìhas been continually biasing towards this fancy even the mightiest intellects -‚Äìperpetually, although imperceptibly, leading them away from the real characteristics of the principle; thus preventing them, up to this date, from ever getting a glimpse of that vital truth which lies in a diametrically opposite direction -‚Äìbehind the principle's essential characteristics -‚Äìthose, not of concentralization or especiality -‚Äìbut of universality and diffusion, this ""vital truth"" is unity as the source of the phaenomenon,"
1028,17,
1029,17,"let me now repeat the definition of gravity, -‚Äìevery atom, of every body, attracts every other atom, both of its own and of every other body, with a force which varies inversely as the squares of the distances of the attracting and attracted atom,"
1030,17,
1031,17,"here let the reader pause with me, for a moment, in contemplation of the miraculous -‚Äìof the ineffable -‚Äìof the altogether unimaginable complexity of relation involved in the fact that each atom attracts every other atom -‚Äìinvolved merely in this fact of the attraction, without reference to the law or mode in which the attraction is manifested -‚Äìinvolved merely in the fact that each atom attracts every other atom at all, in a wilderness of atoms so numerous that those which go to the composition of a cannon-ball, exceed, probably, in mere point of number, all the stars which go to the constitution of the universe,"
1032,17,
1033,17,"had we discovered, simply, that each atom tended to some one favorite point -‚Äìto some especially attractive atom -‚Äìwe should still have fallan upon a discovery which, in itself, would have sufficed to overwhelm the mind, -‚Äìbut what is it that we are actually called upon to comprehend? that each atom attracts -‚Äìsympathizes with the most delicate movements of every other atom, and with each and with all at the same time, and forever, and according to a determinate law of which the complexity, even considered by itself solely, is utterly beyond the grasp of the imagination of man, if i propose to ascertain the influence of one mote in a sunbeam upon its neighboring mote, i cannot accomplish my purpose without first counting and weighing all the atoms in the universe and defining the precise positions of all at one particular moment, if i venture to displace, by even the billionth part of an inch, the microscopical speck of dust which lies now upon the point of my finger, what is the character of that act upon which i have adventured? i have done a deed which shakes the moon in her path, which causes the sun to be no longer the sun, and which alters forever the destiny of the multitudinous myriads of stars that roll and glow in the majestic presence of their creator,"
1034,17,
1035,17,"these ideas -‚Äìconceptions such as these -‚Äìunthought-like thoughts -- soul-reveries rather than conclusions or even considerations of the intellect, -‚Äìideas, i repeat, such as these, are such as we can alone hope profitably to entertain in any effort at grasping the great principle, attraction,"
1036,17,
1037,17,"but now, -‚Äìwith such ideas -‚Äìwith such a vision of the marvellous complexity of attraction fairly in his mind -‚Äìlet any person competent of thought on such topics as these, set himself to the task of imagining a principle for the phaenomena observed -‚Äìa condition from which they sprang,"
1038,17,
1039,17,"does not so evident a brotherhood among the atoms point to a common parentage? does not a sympathy so omniprevalent, so ineradicable, and so thoroughly irrespective, suggest a common paternity as its source? does not one extreme impel the reason to the other? does not the infinitude of division refer to the utterness of individuality? does not the entireness of the complex hint at the perfection of the simple? it is not that the atoms, as we see them, are divided or that they are complex in their relations -‚Äìbut that they are inconceivably divided and unutterably complex, -‚Äìit is the extremeness of the conditions to which i now allude, rather than to the conditions themselves, in a word, not because the atoms were, at some remote epoch of time, even more than together -‚Äìis it not because originally, and therefore normally, they were one -‚Äìthat now, in all circumstances -‚Äìat all points -‚Äìin all directions -‚Äìby all modes of approach -‚Äìin all relations and through all conditions -‚Äìthey struggle back to this absolutely, this irrelatively, this unconditionally one?"
1040,17,
1041,17,"some person may here demand, -‚Äì""why -‚Äìsince it is to the one that the atoms struggle back -‚Äìdo we not find and define attraction 'a merely general tendency to a centre?' -‚Äìwhy, in especial, do not your atoms -‚Äìthe atoms which you describe as having been irradiated from a centre -‚Äìproceed at once, rectilinearly, back to the central point of their origin?"""
1042,17,
1043,17,"i reply that they do; as will be distinctly shown; but that the cause of their so doing is quite irrespective of the centre as such, they all tend rectilinearly towards a centre, because of the sphereicity with which they have been irradiated into space, each atom, forming one of a generally uniform globe of atoms, finds more atoms in the direction of the centre, of course, than in any other, and in that direction, therefore, is impelled -‚Äìbut is not thus impelled because the centre is the point of its origin, it is not to any point that the atoms are allied, it is not any locality, either in the concrete or in the abstract, to which i suppose them bound, nothing like location was conceived as their origin, their source lies in the principle, unity, this is their lost parent, this they seek always -‚Äìimmediately -‚Äìin all directions -‚Äìwherever it is even partially to be found; thus appeasing, in some measure, the ineradicable tendency, while on the way to its absolute satisfaction in the end, it follows from all this, that any principle which shall be adequate to account for the la0 or modus operandi, of the attractive force in general, will account for this law in particular, -- that is to say, any principle which will show why the atoms should tend to their general centre of irradiation with forces inversely proportional to the squares of the distances, will be admitted as satisfactorily accounting, at the same time, for the tendency, according to the same law, of these atoms each to each, -‚Äìfor the tendency to the centre is merely the tendency each to each, and not any tendency to a centre as such, -‚Äìthus it will be seen, also, that the establishment of my propositions would involve no necessity of modification in the terms of the newtonian definition of gravity, which declares that each atom attracts each other atom and so forth, and declares this merely; but always under the supposition that what i propose be, in the end, admitted it seems clear that some error might occasionally be avoided, in the future processes of science, were a more ample phraseology adopted, -‚Äìfor instance, -- ""each atom tends to every other atom &c, with a force &c,, the general result being a tendency of all, with a similar force, to a general centre,"""

1045,17,"the reversal of our processes has thus brought us to an identical result; but, while in the one process intuition was the starting-point, in the other it was the goal, in commencing the former journey i could only say that, with an irresistable intuition, i felt simplicity to have been the characteristic of the original action of god, -‚Äìin ending the latter i can only declare that, with an irresistible intuition, i perceive unity to have been the source of the observed phaenomena of the newtonian gra"

1242,21,      with sweet hopes of thee and thine!
1243,22,"wreathed in myrtle, my sword i'll conceal"
1244,22,"    like those champions devoted and brave,"
1245,22,"when they plunged in the tyrant their steel,"
1246,22,"    and to athens deliverance gave,"

1263,23,of interminable pride -
1264,23,"a mystery, and a dream,"
1265,23,should my early life seem;
1266,23,i say that dream was fraught
1267,23,with a wild and waking thought
1268,23,"of beings that have been,"
1269,23,"which my spirit hath not seen,"
1270,23,"had i let them pass me by,"
1271,23,with a dreaming eye!

1278,23,and my worldly rest hath gone
1279,23,"with a sigh as it passed on,"
1280,23,i care not though it perish

1300,25,              time long ago
1301,25,"            and every gentle air that dallied,"
1302,25,"              in that sweet day,"
1303,25,"            along the ramparts plumed and pallid,"
1304,25,"              a winged odour went away,"

1309,25,            spirits moving musically
1310,25,"              to a lute's well-tuned law,"
1311,25,"            round about a throne, where sitting"

1319,25,"            through which came flowing, flowing, flowing"
1320,25,"              and sparkling evermore,"
1321,25,            a troop of echoes whose sweet duty
1322,25,"              was but to sing,"
1323,25,"            in voices of surpassing beauty,"

1345,26,"how often we forget all time, when lone"
1346,26,admiring nature's universal throne;

1355,26," whose fervid, flickering torch of life was lit"
1356,26,"from the sun and stars, whence he had drawn forth"
1357,26, a passionate light - such for his spirit was fit -
1358,26,and yet that spirit knew - not in the hour
1359,26,"of its own fervour - what had o'er it power,"

1366,26, with more of sovereignty than ancient lore
1367,26,hath ever told - or is it of a thought
1368,26," the unembodied essence, and no more"
1369,26,that with a quickening spell doth o'er us pass
1370,26,"as dew of the night time, o'er the summer grass?"

1378,26,from us in life - but common - which doth lie
1379,26, each hour before us - but then only bid
1380,26,"with a strange sound, as of a harpstring broken"

1387,26,who otherwise would fall from life and heaven
1388,26," drawn by their heart's passion, and that tone,"
1389,26,that high tone of the spirit which hath striven
1390,26, though not with faith - with godliness - whose throne
1391,26,with desperate energy 't hath beaten down;
1392,26,"wearing its own deep feeling as a crown,"

1397,27,"      and the giddy stars so legends tell,"
